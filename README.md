Throughout this project, I have utilized code from 4 main repositories:

MedNeRF (https://github.com/abrilcf/mednerf)
I have used much of the data-loading code from MedNeRF, as well as their chest x-ray dataset.

GRAF (https://github.com/autonomousvision/graf)
Since the MedNeRF codebase utilizes data-loading GRAF code, I have also used this code.

Itâ€™s NeRF From Nothing: Build A Complete NeRF with PyTorch (https://towardsdatascience.com/its-nerf-from-nothing-build-a-vanilla-nerf-with-pytorch-7846e4c45666 and https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TppdSsLz8uKoNwqJqDGg8se8BHQcvg_K?usp=sharing)
I have used the base NeRF implementation provided by Mason McGough in his article linked above.

NeRF (https://github.com/bmild/nerf)
While I have not used much code from this repository, my NeRF-style framework is fundamentally built on top of theirs. Credit to Mildenhall et al., who created NeRF.
